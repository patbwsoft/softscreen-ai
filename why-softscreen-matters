### softscreen-vision

I didn’t build SoftScreen just to blur dogs on TV.

I built it because I saw a bigger future — one where families, pet owners, trauma survivors, and neurodivergent viewers could finally *take back control* of what’s on their screen.

Not by turning it off. Not by canceling subscriptions.  
But by adjusting the experience *on their terms.*

We’ve filtered email. We’ve blocked ads.  
But video? Live content? HDMI input?

Nobody’s given people a real tool for that — especially not one that runs offline, respects privacy, and works in real-time.

SoftScreen changes that.

Whether it’s dogs that set off your own dog…  
or alcohol bottles that bring up pain…  
or flashes of violence that make you spiral…

This blur box might seem small, but its impact is personal.

I believe edge AI belongs in the home.  
And I believe blur is just the beginning.
