# SoftScreen Milestone Log

**Date:** May 1, 2025 – 9:05 PM  
**Event:** MVP Launch & Autonomous Reflection Success

---

### Summary

SoftScreen MVP was launched successfully via Streamlit. A user uploaded a video, processed it through the full Mello engine, and received a complete journaled reflection.

Mello tracked 3,380 objects, misclassified many as 'cow', and recommended both a `max_missing_frames` adjustment and a model upgrade.

> User described the moment as:  
> “So fuckin cool my brain can’t really articulate.”

### Key Achievements

- First full run of Mello inside a public-facing interface  
- Reflection log auto-generated and visible in-app  
- Decision logic triggered based on top_class='cow'  
- Blur core, UX, and reflection loop all connected

---

### Notes

This marked the moment SoftScreen moved from prototype to **working adaptive AI tool**. The system now functions as a full loop:  
→ Detect → Reflect → Improve.

---

### Next Steps

- UI polishing  
- User feedback collection  
- Reflection depth improvement  
- Add audio filtering pipeline
