#  SoftScreen/Mello Dev Session Notes - 4/28/2025

✅ Finalized and sent out 10+ real-world outreach emails (kennels, autism centers).
✅ Recognized friends/family feedback delay is normal — pivoted to real users smartly.
✅ Built momentum by pivoting straight into Mello upgrades (no sitting in nervousness).

✅ Mello v1.5 ➔ Confidence Boost and Blur Strength Mod
- Stronger confidence building when objects are seen
- Slower decay when objects are missed
- Blur now fades dynamically based on confidence level

✅ Mello v1.6 ➔ Smooth Visuals and Memory HUD
- Fixed Matplotlib stealing focus from OpenCV video
- Added live memory counter HUD on videos (" Memories: 5")

✅ Mello v1.7 ➔ Time Machine Mode
- Brain saves now create unique, timestamped CSVs and graphs for every run
- Enabled brain evolution tracking across sessions

✅ Mello v1.8 ➔ Config Wizard Upgrade
- Created first `settings.yaml` spellbook
- Mello now loads all key parameters from `settings.yaml` at startup
- No code editing needed for tuning anymore — just change the YAML
- Configurable params: detection confidence, blur strength, frame size, memory decay rates, more

✅ First successful test run with YAML settings
- Mello reached 40 active memories (highest yet)
- Confidence stayed steady across majority of frames
- Full brain snapshots saved cleanly and archived
- Powershell + HUD clean, smooth, and powerful feeling

✅ Session Mindset
- Handled technical setbacks with no frustration
- Pivoted smoothly between outreach, coding, testing
- Built long-term systems instead of just chasing short-term wins
- Made the session about growth and real-world scaling
