# SoftScreen Audio Filtering â€” Log #03: Temporal Audio Blur Activated

**Date:** July 30, 2025  
**Milestone:** Audio-triggered blur now lasts 1.5 seconds per spike

---

### What We Did

- Updated `TemporalMemory` to extend blur *beyond* the exact audio spike frame
- Audio-triggered blur now persists for **1.5 seconds** after each detected spike
- Added `"ðŸ”Š AUDIO BLUR"` overlay on spike-driven frames for visual confirmation
- Ran full test with overlapping bark spikes â€” confirmed blur chaining works

---

### Code Highlight

```python
linger_frames = int(1.5 * fps)  # blur for 1.5 seconds after each spike
for frame in frame_spikes:
    for offset in range(linger_frames):
        self.spike_frames.add(frame + offset)
```

### Why This Matters

Mello can now **hold the blur** through real-world sensory intensity â€” just like a human brain does.

This sets the stage for:
- Emotional or panic-triggered filters
- Gradual blur fade-outs
- Longform sensory prediction windows
