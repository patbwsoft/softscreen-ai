SOFTSCREEN MILESTONE LOG
Date: May 01, 2025 â€“ 09:05 PM
Event: MVP Launch & Autonomous Reflection Success

Summary:
SoftScreen MVP was launched successfully via Streamlit. A user was able to upload a video, process it through the full Mello engine, and receive a complete journaled reflection. Mello identified that she had tracked 3,380 objects, misclassified many as 'cow', and then recommended both a max_missing_frames adjustment and a model upgrade.

Key Achievements:
- First full run of Mello inside a public-facing interface
- Reflection log was auto-generated and visible in-app
- Decision logic triggered based on top_class='cow'
- User described the moment as 'so fuckin cool my brain cant really articulate'

Notes:
This marks the first moment SoftScreen crossed from 'prototype' to 'working adaptive AI tool'. The UX, intelligence loop, and blur core are now all functioning as a single system.

Next Steps:
- Begin UI polishing and user feedback integration
- Continue training and improving reflection depth
- Add audio filtering pipeline
