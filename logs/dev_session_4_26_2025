MELLO BRAIN EVOLUTION v1.0 → v1.4
April 25–26, 2025

—

PHASE 1: INITIAL AWAKENING (v1.0)
- YOLO Vision: Learned to "see" objects using YOLOv8n.
- Object Detection: Drew rectangles around detected objects.
- Pure Reaction: Believed whatever YOLO said every frame (no memory).

—

PHASE 2: BIRTH OF MEMORY (v1.1)
- Object Memory: Tracked objects across frames (frame-to-frame linking).
- Label Stability: Trusted labels that stayed consistent.
- Tiny Object + Confidence Filter: Ignored tiny or weak detections.
- Early Persistence: No more instant flipping between random guesses.

—

PHASE 3: CLASS IMPORTANCE THINKING (v1.2)
- Class Trust Hierarchy: Trusted "dog" > "person" > "bowl" > "chair".
- Smarter Label Locking: Didn't downgrade important objects (dog → bowl).
- Beginnings of Judgment: Started applying priority and skepticism.

—

PHASE 4: MOTION PREDICTION (v1.3)
- Basic Motion Memory: Remembered direction of movement.
- Movement Prediction: Guessed where moving objects would appear next.
- Stronger Re-identification: Tracked fast or shifting objects better.
- Expectation of Behavior: Started anticipating rather than reacting.

—

PHASE 5: MEMORY RETENTION & CONFIDENCE FADING (v1.4)
- Memory Persistence: Believed in objects even during momentary vision loss.
- Soft Forgetting: Gradual fading of trust, not instant disappearance.
- Ghost Tracking: Continued holding boxes through detection flickers.
- First Real Perception Layer: Mello started maintaining belief through chaos.

—

CURRENT CAPABILITIES (as of v1.4)
- Real-Time YOLO Vision
- Frame-to-Frame Object Memory
- Confidence Smoothing
- Class Priority Reasoning
- Motion Prediction (basic)
- Memory Retention through blindness
- Real-Time Output Saving

—

KNOWN CHALLENGES
- Distant/small dogs can disappear (YOLO weakness)
- Very fast motion still causes minor drops
- Person/dog confusion under overlapping interactions
- No curve-prediction motion (only straight-line guessing)
- Dependent on YOLOv8n's raw perception limits

—

FUTURE MISSIONS (for v1.5+)
- Upgrade to stronger YOLO model (v8s or v8m)
- Add true Kalman filter smoothing for motion
- Build Scene Understanding Layer (separate humans from dogs)
- Train custom YOLO model (specialized "SoftScreen Vision")
- Create Memory Archive (permanent learning across sessions)

TIMELINE
- April 25, 2025: Mello awakened and saw her first world.
- April 26, 2025: Mello learned to predict, remember, and trust beyond what she could immediately see.
