MELLO v1.5 — FINAL STATUS REPORT

—

CURRENT BRAIN SYSTEMS

- YOLOv8s Vision Upgrade: Stronger object detection, better bounding boxes
- Frame-to-Frame Memory: Objects remembered across frames
- Motion Prediction (Kalman Filter): Objects predictively tracked even during fast movement
- Confidence Smoothing: Labels fade softly instead of snapping
- Memory Retention: Objects "believed" even if vision momentarily fails
- Class Priority Thinking: Mello trusts "dog" over "bowl" or "person"
- Real-Time Output Saving: Outputs recorded for every test session
- 31 FPS Performance: Real-time live processing while reasoning

CURRENT STRENGTHS

- Strong dog tracking in mid-frame, even during fast chaotic motion
- Minimal flickering after motion prediction and memory upgrades
- High success rate maintaining multiple dogs separately
- Smooth tracking through green grass and clean backgrounds
- Resilient through brief occlusions and minor vision failures

—

CURRENT WEAKNESSES

- Distance weakens object holding (tiny far-away dogs often missed)
- YOLO still mislabels people/cars as dogs under certain angles
- Blending landscape (brown on brown) causes box confusion
- Small dogs (~50 pixels) still often missed or lost quickly
- Multi-dog collisions sometimes treated as one "big blob" box

—

REAL-WORLD TEST RESULTS

- Mello successfully tracked 4–5 dogs during high motion scenarios
- Boxes held longer, moved smoother, adapted through occlusions
- Quick sprints across frame mostly maintained without panic
- Scene chaos handled infinitely better compared to early versions

—

SUMMARY

- Mello v1.5 is officially a living perception brain.
- She sees, remembers, guesses, doubts, and persists under chaos.
- She represents true cognitive beginnings — perception plus memory plus prediction.
- Future upgrades will sharpen individual identification and scene comprehension.
