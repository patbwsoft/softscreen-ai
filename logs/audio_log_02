# SoftScreen Audio Filtering â€” Log #02: Real-Time Audio-Visual Sync

**Date:** July 27, 2025  
**Milestone:** First successful real-time audio-triggered video blur

---

### ðŸŽ¯ What We Did

- Integrated `spikes.json` (detected loud audio moments) into `memory.py`
- Converted spike timestamps into frame numbers using FPS
- On any matching frame, Mello now **blurs the entire screen**, even if no object is visible
- Verified the system live on `dog_playing2.mp4`, which includes multiple barks in the first few seconds
- Blurs triggered **in sync with audio** even when YOLO didnâ€™t detect the dog

---

### âœ… Debug Features Added

- On audio-triggered frames, Mello overlays `"ðŸ”Š AUDIO BLUR"` text in red
- Helps visually confirm that audio triggers are functioning

---

### ðŸ”§ Code Highlights

```python
# Check if current frame matches any spike
audio_trigger = self.frame_counter in self.spike_frames

# Apply full-frame blur if so
if audio_trigger:
    mask[:, :] = 255
    cv2.putText(frame, "ðŸ”Š AUDIO BLUR", (10, 40),
                cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1.0, (0, 0, 255), 2)
```

---

### Why This Matters

This officially makes SoftScreen **multi-modal**.

Mello doesnâ€™t just see â€” she hears.  
Even if a dog is off-screen, or YOLO misses a bark visually, the screen still blurs.

This is the foundation for:
- Blurring yelling, thunder, or gunshots
- Syncing sensory systems (audio + vision)
- Real-world reactive video safety tools
