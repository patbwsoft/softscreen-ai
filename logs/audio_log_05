audio_log_5:
- Retrained `audio_classifier.pkl` using an expanded dataset covering 7 categories:
  bark, doorbell, gunshot, explosion, baby cry, human, and weather
- Improved classification stability with broader sample variety
- Extended spike hold logic (0.8s cooldown) to maintain dB attenuation beyond transient peaks
- Output includes blurred audio and `spikes.json` with timestamps + predicted labels
- Ready for next stage: Mello integration and memory binding
