# SoftScreen Audio Filtering — Log #01: Hearing for the First Time

**Date:** July 27, 2025  
**Author:** Patrick Wilcox  
**Milestone:** First successful audio parsing + volume analysis in SoftScreen

###  What We Did

Today marks the very first step toward teaching SoftScreen how to **hear**.

We built a simple Python script that:
- Loads an audio file (`.wav`)
- Measures how loud it is
- Breaks it into small chunks (like frames in video)
- Prints the loudness of each chunk over time

This is the beginning of our **audio blur pipeline** — a system that will detect and soften intense sounds like:
- Dog barks
- Doorbells
- Screaming
- Gunshots
- Profanity
- Storms or thunder
- Baby cry
---

###  Tools Used

- [`pydub`](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub): For slicing and analyzing audio
- `ffmpeg`: To decode audio formats like `.wav`, `.aac`, `.mp3`
- Python 3.10 (running locally, not on Jetson yet)

---

###  The Code (v1)

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.utils import make_chunks

# Load audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("bark_example.wav")

# Split into 200ms chunks
CHUNK_LENGTH_MS = 200
chunks = make_chunks(audio, CHUNK_LENGTH_MS)

# Print loudness of each chunk
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    timestamp = i * (CHUNK_LENGTH_MS / 1000)
    volume = chunk.dBFS
    print(f"[{timestamp:.2f}s] Volume: {volume:.2f} dBFS")
```

---

###  Why This Matters

In video, SoftScreen detects **where** something intense is (like a dog), and blurs it.

In audio, we now detect **when** something intense happens — like a bark spike — and can mute or dampen that exact moment.

This opens the door to real-time **audio filtering**, which we’ll later sync with the video blur system to make SoftScreen fully multi-modal.

###  What’s Next?

- Visualize the waveform + spike markers
- Automatically flag loud chunks
- Start experimenting with spectral fingerprints (dog barks vs. thunder)
- Eventually add the ability to **mute, muffle, or replace** these sounds on export
- Port this pipeline to the Jetson T201 edge box for live HDMI processing
- Automatically add closed captioning for muted trigger sounds
