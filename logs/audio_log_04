# SoftScreen Audio Filtering — Log #04: Cooldown + Persistent Overlay

**Date:** July 31, 2025

---

### ✅ What’s New
- Added cooldown after audio spikes (prevents constant blur)
- `"AUDIO BLUR"` overlay now stays visible for full 1.5s window
- Blur behavior feels smoother and more human

Tested on `dog_playing2.mp4` — confirmed shorter, intentional blur spikes that line up with barking.
